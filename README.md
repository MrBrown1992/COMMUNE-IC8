## Die WG-Webapp

SWENGA Project


This web application is for maintaining and organizing a shared flat. It should make the life of a main tenant easier by providing a tool that makes it able to create, edit and export grocery lists so every roomer of the flat knows what kind of grocery is at home and what needs to be bought. Additionally, there will be a To-Do-Plan where To-Doâ€™s can be added and marked with categories (e.g.: cleaning, appointments ...)
